# Smart contract verification

Once a smart contract is deployed to the Acala Evm+ network, it can be verified in various ways depending on the deployment framework and the complexity of the contract. Here's how to manually verify a deployed smart contract.

When following this guide, make sure your wallet is connected. We will be using the Metamask wallet in this tutorial. For detailed instructions on how to verify a smart contract, please refer to the [Blockscout](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-users/verifying-a-smart-contract) document.

- Copy the address where the smart contract is deployed.

- Navigate to [Block Explorer](https://blockscout.acala.network/) and paste the contract address into the search box. This will open a page labeled "Contract Address Details".

- Scroll down and click on the **Contracts** option.

- Click **Verify & Publish** to jump to the verification page.

- Fill in and verify according to your contract situation.

- After filling in, click **Verify & Publish** to verify.
